# HSPcrypt
Requires: HSP 3.7 beta<br>
Dependency: <a href="http://type74.org/rijndll.php">Rijn.dll by Type74.org</a><br>
<br>
This tool is for testing DLLs used with HSP and for encryption/hashing.<br>
<br>
ToDo:<br>
- Multiple file processing
- Save the hash of the original file to judge whether the file was decrypted correctly. (However, how to save it safely requires further study.)
